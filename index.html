            <h1>The World of Pokémon</h1>
            <p>Pokémon are wonderous creatures that can be 
                caught in Pokéballs. People who catch pokémon 
                are called Trainers. Trainers will mostly use 
                their pokémon to fight with other trainers. In 
                each game, you are a young trainer, brand-new 
                to the training scene. Each generation of 
                Pokémon games takes place in a specific region 
                of the Pokémon world with its own collection 
                of specific pokémon.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each region also has a Pokémon professor, who 
                introduces you as the main character to being 
                a pokémon trainer and will give you a starter 
                pokémon. They will also give you a pokédex, an 
                electronic encyclopedia of pokémon, and ask you 
                to fill it out. As you catch and evolve specific 
                pokémon, the corresponding pokédex entry will be 
                filled in.
            </p>
            <p>You also have the option to participate in the 
                Pokémon League. With some exceptions, each 
                region has a total of 8 pokémon gyms, designed 
                to test your abilities as a pokémon trainer. 
                After beating a gym, you obtain that gym's 
                badge. After getting all 8 badges from the 
                gyms, you can then enter Victory Road and 
                challenge the Pokémon League, which consist 
                of a group of powerful trainers called the 
                Elite Four, and the region's champion, who is 
                the strongest of all. After beating the 
                champion, you are proclaimed the champion and 
                have beaten the game.
