            <h1>Mechanics of Pokémon</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Now that we have a premise on the world of Pokémon, let's dive into how battles work.</p>
            <img src="images/detective-pikachu.JPG" alt="Pikachu sleuthing the mechanics">
            <div id="types">
                <h2>Types</h2>
                <p>Each type has other types that it's strong, weak, and/or immune to or against. For a more 
                    in-depth explanation about how the different types interact, visit the Types page. <br>
                    Pokémon can have either one or two types. Pokémon moves only have one.
                </p>
                <p>There are 18 different pokémon types; Normal, Fire, Water, Electric, Grass, Ice, Fighting,
                    Poison, Ground, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Rock, Ghost, Dragon, Dark, Steel, and Fairy.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="levels">
                <h2>Levels and Experience</h2>
                <p>Each pokémon has a level, starting from level 1 and capping at level 100. As you might expect, higher-leveled pokémon
                    are stronger than lower-leveled ones. Pokémon gain levels by fighting and defeating other
                    pokémon in battle. The stronger the knocked-out pokémon, the more experience (or exp.) is gained. <br>
                    Gaining levels allow pokémon to become stronger by increasing their stats, allowing them to
                    learn moves, and enabling evolution.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="stats">
                <h2>Stats</h2>
                <p>Every pokémon has 6 base stats. These stats indicate how strong a pokemon is in a certain
                    aspect, and they scale with level. These stats are how many hit points it has (HP), their
                    physical strength (Attack, or Atk), their physical defence (Defense, or Def), their special
                    strength (Special Attack, or Sp. Atk), their special defence (Sp. Def), and how quickly they
                    can act every turn (Speed).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="moves">
                <h2>Moves</h2>
                <p>Each move has a type, a category, a base power, and a base accuracy. Some damaging moves may have secondary effects,
                    like decreasing the opposing pokémon's accuracy or inflicting a status condition. <br>
                    The type will be one of the 18 pokémon types, and if the pokémon that is using the move shares
                    a type with the move, then the power of the move will increase (called the Same Type Attack Bonus,
                    or STAB). <br> The category of a move determines if the move is physical, special, or a status move.
                    If the move is physical or special, the move will use the corresponding stat for calculating damage
                    (Atk and Sp. Atk, respectively). Status moves have no damage associated with them. <br>
                    The move's base power and base accuracy are pretty self-expalatory. Some moves are more powerful
                    than others, and most moves have a base accuracy of 100 (out of 100).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="abilities">    
                <h2>Abilities</h2>
                <p>Every pokémon has a certain ability that alters how they interact with the game.
                    This can be anything from increasing the power of moves with a certain type, increasing
                    (or decreasing) the accuracy of moves, or even enabling certain types of moves to go first
                    in the turn order.<br>Every species of pokémon has one or two abilities that they have access
                    to in the wild, and often have a "hidden ability" not usually found on a wild pokémon. Hidden
                    abilities can be obtained by using certain items on a pokémon or bred down from parents who
                    have it already.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="evolution">
                <h2>Evolutions</h2>
                <p>Some pokémon have the potential to evolve when certain conditions are met,
                    often by reaching a certain level or by using a certain item. Evolving a
                pokémon often will increase the stats of that pokémon and expand the pool
                of moves that that specific pokémon can learn. Sometimes, it may even add
                a secondary type to the pokémon.</p>
                <h4>When to evolve?</h4>
                <p>Evolution will increase the base stats that a pokémon has, which makes it more useful,
                    but will often make pokémon learn moves at a later level than their
                    unevolved counterparts do. For example, Bulbasaur evolves at level 16 into Ivysaur.
                    Ivysaur learns the move Seed Bomb at level 20, but Bulbasaur learns Seed Bomb at
                    level 18. Likewise, Ivysaur learns the move Solar Beam at level 50, but Bulbasaur
                    learns it at level 36. If you want to let your pokémon learn more powerful moves
                    sooner, it's a good idea to not evolve them until they learn that move.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="status">
                <h2>Status Conditions</h2>
                <p>Status Conditions. Status conditions are conditions your pokémon can have
                    that affect it in a negative way, often by inflicting damage over time
                    and/or inhibiting the pokémon in some way. For example, a poisoned pokémon
                    will take damage every round. A burned pokémon, however, will take damage every
                    round, but in addition, their attack stat is cut in half.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="items">
                <h2>Items</h2>
                <p>Pokémon are able to hold up to a single item in battle. Items affect the pokémon
                    in some way, such as increasing damage dealt by moves of a certain type . Items
                    also can be consumable for a strong one-time effect, such as healing the pokémon
                    or allowing them to survive a hit that would result in a one-hit knock-out (OHKO),
                    which would take them from full HP to 0.
                </p>
                <p>Other items are meant to only be used and not held by a pokémon in battle, such as most
                    healing items or pokéballs, which allow you to capture pokémon and add them to your team.
