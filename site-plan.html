      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Because some people want to know what kind of game Pokémon
        is without having to buy the game, this website will explain the mechanics of the 
        Pokémon games. It will help people new to the franchise
        understand how pokémon interact in-game and contain 
        a tool for people who are just beginning to play.

        Page 1 – The World of Pokémon
        <ul>
          <li>Pokémon are wonderous creatures that can be caught in Pokéballs. People who catch pokémon are called Trainers. Trainers will mostly use their pokémon to fight with other trainers. In each game, you are a young trainer, brand-new to the training scene. Each generation of Pokémon games takes place in a specific region of the Pokémon world with its own collection of specific pokémon.</li>
          <li>Each region also has a Pokémon professor, who introduces you as the main character to being a pokémon trainer and will give you a starter pokémon. They will also give you a pokédex, an electronic encyclopedia of pokémon, and ask you to fill it out. As you catch and evolve specific pokémon, the corresponding pokédex entry will be filled in. </li>
          <li>You also have the option to participate in the Pokémon League. With some exceptions, each region has a total of 8 pokémon gyms, designed to test your abilities as a pokémon trainer. After beating a gym, you obtain that gym’s badge. After getting all 8 badges from the gyms, you can then enter Victory Road and challenge the Pokémon League, which consist of a group of powerful trainers called the Elite Four, and the region’s champion, who is the strongest of all. After beating the champion, you are proclaimed the champion and beat the game.
          </li>

      <h3>Pokémon Mechanics</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each pokémon has a few traits; type(s), stats, abilities, moves, and evolutions. Each pokémon can also hold an item</li>
          <li>Types. Each type has other types that it’s strong, weak, and/or immune to or against. Pokémon can have either one or two types. Pokémon moves only have one.</li>
          <li>Stats. Pokémon have stats related to HP, Attack (Atk), Defense (Def), Special Attack (Sp. Atk), Special Defense (Sp. Def), and Speed (Spd).</li>
          <li>Abilities. Pokémon can have anywhere from 1 to 3 potential abilities that alter how they work (for example, most starter pokémon given to you by the region’s professor will have an ability that raises the power of moves that share a type with that pokémon if the pokémon’s health gets low).</li>
          <li>Moves. Each move has a type, a category, a base power, and a base accuracy. Some damaging moves may have secondary abilities.</li>
          <li>Evolutions. Some pokémon have the potential to evolve when certain conditions are met, often by reaching a certain level or by using a certain item. Evolved pokémon often will increase the stats of that pokémon and expand the pool of moves that specific pokémon can learn. Sometimes, it may even add a secondary type to the pokémon.
            <br>-	When to evolve? Evolution will increase the base stats that a pokémon has, which makes it more useful, but will often make pokémon learn moves at a later level than their unevolved counterparts do.</li>
          <li>Status Conditions. Status conditions are conditions your pokémon can have that affect it in a negative way, often by inflicting damage over time and/or inhibiting the pokémon in some way.</li>
          <li>Items. Affect the pokémon in some way, such as increase damage dealt by moves of a certain type. Also can be consumable for a one-time effect, such as healing the pokémon in exchange for being consumed.</li>
        </ul>

      </ul>
      <h3>Type Breakdown Tool</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>This will hold a tool, run in javascript, that will allow the user to select a type from a dropbox, and the statistics for that type (what types it’s weak against, what it’s strong against, and, if applicable, what move types it is immune to, and what types are immune to it).</li>
          <li>Since a single pokémon can have two types, I'll include a link to pokemondb's more expansive dual-type chart; url = https://pokemondb.net/type/dual</li>
          <li>Since this tool is dynamic and graphic, I think it would count as one or both images, right?</li>
